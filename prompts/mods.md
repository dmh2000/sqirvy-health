change the Add Food Item diaglog as follows:

- the Food Name3 fields should be a dropdown that is populated by all food items in the database
- the units field should be read only and populated by the unit value from the food database for the selected item
- the calories field should be read only and populated by the calories value from the food database for the selected item

I will add the ability to add food items into the database later
